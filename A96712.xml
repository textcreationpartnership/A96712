            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The doctrine of Antipae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſm was preached in many places in IRELAND, and I again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain challenged to diſpute this point; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reſolved to give place to none ſuch, no
<pb facs="tcp:151468:10"/> not for an hour, (it being urged as a thing ſo neceſſary to ſalvation by many) that the truth of the Goſpel might continue with us, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Circumciſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. but did publickly disown that way and practice, which though watered by the foot of man, as Aegypt: yet was never watered by the dew of heaven, as Canaan) &amp; accordingly I found (bleſſed be his glorious grace who delighteth to breath in ſuch poor worms as I am) more of Gods preſence in the publick diſpenſing of that Ordinance of infant baptiſm, (aſſuring me by his ſpirit that he would own it and bleſs it to the babes) than ever I did in all my days, theſe eight and twenty years ſince I entered into the Miniſtry; to which I was called from my childhood, and aſſured I ſhould win ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls. This I ſpeak in humility of ſpirit, (as knowing my ſelf to be the chief of ſinners) not to magnifie my ſelf, but to magnifie mine Office, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth in the firſt and ſecond Chapters to the <hi>Galatians. Paul</hi> knew that if thoſe teachers could enervate his authoritie, and make his calling void, his doctrine would be ſlighted and made of none effect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he labors to prove by many Arguments
<pb facs="tcp:151468:5"/> that he was called from heaven to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; eſpecially by the good ſucceſs the Lord gave, <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſent to the Gentiles, as Peter to the Jews: for he that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ought effectually by Peter to the circumciſion, was mighty in me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gentiles. Gal.</hi> 2.7.8.</p>
            <p>In theſe lines I look at Chriſt as ſtanding by, and overlooking what I am doing, who well knows with how many prayers and tears I have looked upon the ſeveral texts mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Treatiſe; (for I often think, what would Chriſt ſay to ſuch a text if he were to preach on ſuch a ſubject? or will Chriſt own this or that truth another day?) begging of the father of lights, from whom every good giving and perfect gift doth come, that he would lead me into all truth; and not ſuffer me to build upon his foundation, wood, hay, and ſtubble, leaſt the day ſhould diſcover it, and I ſuffer loſs either of my labor or crown (making it leſs maſſie and weighty, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many pearls in it) another day. And I am aſſured that thoſe prayers ſhall not prove abortive: for the prayers of the ſaints dyed in the bloud of Chriſt are of eternal efficacie; there being a neceſſity and tie lying upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova
<pb facs="tcp:151468:6"/> that they ſhould be fulfilled in due time, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. However if Chriſt take pleaſure in me, here I am: if not, let him do with me what ſeemeth good in his ſight.</p>
            <p>I have not affected enamel'd phraſes, and words of mans wiſdom, (which perhaps are expected from one in my capacity) but with as much plainneſs as I could, I have held forth the truth as it is in Jeſus. The riches of Greece did not conſiſt in words, ſaid <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> of old. Therefore I had rather ſay <hi>Oſsum</hi> than <hi>Os,</hi> with Auſtin, leaſt I ſhould not be underſtood. <hi>Cibus ſimplex est optimus,</hi> the plaineſt meats nouriſh moſt. We ſay of a diamond, <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid abſconditur perditur;</hi> for truth is like to Adam, never ſo glorious as when it's naked. Therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, we uſe plainneſs of ſpeech. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.</p>

            <p>However though many will not own this disgraced truth, I am aſſured that Chriſt will own it another day, and then truth will be truth: in the mean time put it in the open field and let it work out it ſelf, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it will; for all truth is from the ſpirit, which onely is able to make way for it in the hearts of the ſons of men, and to batter down thoſe ſtrong holds, even thoſe royal forts of the imagination and will, that ſtand out in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the truths of Ieſus.</p>

            <p>I do not ſay that the promiſe or Covenant ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered, is a ground to us to annex the ſeal; but this I ſay, That a promiſe laid for the foundation of a duty, is equivalent with an expreſs command. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Act. 2.37.</hi> comp. <hi>Gen. 17 9.</hi> pag. <hi>28.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Covenant of Grace is conditional, page. <hi>89.</hi> whereof baptiſm is a ſeal; therefore Divines ſay, The external Covenant (or rather the external part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) may be broken, but the internal cannot. And whereas I admit of conditions in the Covenant of grace, I mean not by conditions ſuch as are <hi>(1.)</hi> the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant; Or <hi>(2.)</hi> as by ſome are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to be, <hi>ſc.</hi> the impulſive cauſe inducing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the Lord to enter into this Covenant with us; Or <hi>(3.)</hi> ſuch as are to be performed by us of our own power; Or <hi>(4.)</hi> ſuch as are meritorious, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the nature of grace: But ſuch as Chriſt hath freely undertaken to work in the elect, being generally propounded to all on the terms of the Goſpel; which if accepted, render them and theirs viſibly under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of which baptiſm is the ſeal. Therefore I ſay, The Arminians may take as much advantage from the invitations of God to faith and repentance, as from the conditions tendered to the ſons of men. <hi>Fidem poni ut conditionem ſalutem quidem antecedentem, ſed electionem ipſam conſequentem, nunquam à noſtris negatum fuit, ſummâ vero cum religione traditum.</hi> Ameſ.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151468:12"/> the Argument by which he enforceth the exhortation, which is taken from the Promiſe or the Covenant (for thoſe terms are equipollent) which, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, is to you and to your Children; to you <hi>Iews</hi> and Proſelytes already called, and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which are afar off, when called, and to their Children; for there is the like reaſon to them, (as Proſelytes and their Children) elſe to what purpoſe ſhould he bring this Medium [for the promiſe is to you and to your Children] to back the exhortation, [and let every one of you be baptized] if Children were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that command? Which would render the Apoſtles Argument altogether inadaequate to his ſcope and purpoſe; but if we include them, the Argumentation is comprehenſive of its end, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to its ſcope.

            <p>Firſt, It is a waſhing of a believer, or Child of a believer, with water, by a Miniſter of Chriſt, in or into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>

Now their waſhings or baptiſms were by ſprinkling or caſting water upon the party waſhed, as well as otherwiſe; for <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, that ſprinkling the Apoſtle makes a ſpecies of the former waſhing. Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151468:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> pour clean water upon you.</hi> Yea, what was the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.2. but the pouring out of the Holy Ghoſt? which is oppoſed to John's baptizing with water. And therefore I ſay, that though we ſhould grant (which they cannot eaſily prove) that they went into the water in thoſe hot Countries, ſometimes as conveniencie ſerved: yet its not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concluded from the text that they were dipped, but that the water was caſt upon them, rather than they caſt into the water, according to the cuſtom in ſome Countries to this day. Thus the water was poured on the Ark, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. the like figure or antitype whereunto baptiſm doth now ſave us; Had the Ark been dipped in the water, all the world in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability had been drowned. Yea this pouring of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the party baptized doth better reſemble the application of the bloud of Chriſt, which is rather done by applying it to us, through the Spirit, than our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our ſelves to it.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>This Covenant <hi>[I will be thy God]</hi> was before the Law, and therefore was not made void by the Law, and the ceremonies annexed thereunto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>That the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gentiles,</hi> which bleſſing extends to fathers and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And yet even the Children of ſuch had a right unto Circumciſion, though their parents were ſuſpended from the Paſsover, as being Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant.</p>

            <p>The 11 Argument is taken from the abſurdities that will follow from the contrary tenent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Children be excluded then the Covenant is not the ſame, ſeeing the perſons engaging are not the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then are the Children of believers no more priviledged than the Children of heathens; for even the Children of heathens (when called) have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant and Seal, as well as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believers.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is a palpable miſtake, as appears clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Thou foundeſt his heart</hi> faithful <hi>before thee, and madeſt a Covenant with him, to give the land of Canaan to his ſeed, and haſt performed thy words, for thou art rightous.</hi> What can be more plain than this, that the land of Canaan was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him conſidered as a working but as a believing <hi>Abraham?</hi> But becauſe the main ſtreſs of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Antipaedobaptiſts lies here, (for they do confeſs and publickly have affirmed, That if that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> were a Covenant of grace, there is no queſtion but that the ſeal of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm muſt be annexed) therefore I ſhall be the more copious in ſhewing you that the land of Canaan was not given by a Covenant of works, but by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God doth engage to be his God, and the God of his ſeed; which implies more than a temporal bleſſing, for it's as much as if he had ſaid.</p>
            <p>Firſt,</p>
            <p>I will viſibly own thy ſeed in the world, above all the people under heaven, whereupon he ſets up his Tabernacle and erects his Church amongſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:151468:41"/> them: he gives them his word and ordinances, he hath not dealt ſo with any nation, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, yea he vouchſafeth his own preſence and that in a glorious manner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When he ſaith, <hi>I will give thee the land of Canaan,</hi> and, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> his meaning is, I will give them a viſible ſubſiſtance in the world; thus he made good his word to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had the uſe of that land though not by way of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the promiſe lay ſo warm and ſo near his heart and did ſo glow upon his ſpirit, as that by faith he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it as his own. (as it is with many a gracious ſpirit in theſe days, that expects the fulfilling of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious promiſes.) For faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and giveth being to ſuch things as have no being themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If they take me for their God, I will be their God, and give unto them the (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. Canaan it ſelf was not given as a mere tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſing, but as a type and pledge of ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings. Therefore,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It was called the land of <hi>Emmanuel, Eſ.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hence it's made a great part of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that land, that it flowed with milk and honey, even the ordinances of God ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the honey and the honey-comb,<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3.

If they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in that land, God would have been aſhamed to own them as Children; but now they deſire a better Country (ſaith the Apoſtle) therefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God. Hence it was that the Lord loved that land above all other lands in the world; and in that, <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem, Sion; (he loved the gates of</hi> Sion <hi>more than all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.) in <hi>Sion,</hi> the Temple; and in the Temple, the Holy-of-holies. "The nearer any thing comes to God, the more he loves it.</p>

            <p>Sixtly, It had been little comfort to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed to have had onely a temporal portion ſealed to them. Others of his Children were before the Children of promiſe for outwards, <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith

            <p>Sevently, The bondmen born in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s houſe had no inheritance in the land of Canaan, yet were circumciſed; yea <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed for the ſpace of 430 years enjoyed it not; therefore Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not ſolely a ſeal of the land of Canaan; for as thoſe had no right unto it: ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity enjoyed it not for that ſpace.</p>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:151468:46"/> the Lord leaves himſelf in pawn (that I may ſo ſay) till he had made good his promiſe to him; But in <hi>cap.</hi> 17.22. he more fully explains the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, The V. Commandment is not carnal, though it have a temporal promiſe annexed to it; <hi>Eph.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. <hi>5.16. Ut prolongent dies]</hi> Poteſt verbum accipi imperſonaliter, prolongent, pro eo quod eſt prolongen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Junius.</hi>

May it not be ſpiritual though the Lord engage to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed to give them that temporal land of Canaan? and ſhall we ſay this Covenant is a temporal and a carnal Covenant? hath not godlineſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this life and that which is to come? They might as well have ſaid the ten Commandments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to us, becauſe (<hi>Deut.</hi> 5.) they are enforced with this conſideration <hi>[which brought thee out of the land of Aegypt;]</hi> though in a ſpiritual ſenſe that may be applyed to us, as literally to the Jews.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, <hi>Abraham</hi> was heir of the world by virtue of the Covenant of grace, and ſurely Canaan was included in that promiſe, as being a little world in the great world. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>The promiſe that he ſhould be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the rightouſneſs of faith:</hi> Where you ſee it's plainly oppoſed to the Covenant of works.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:151468:46"/>
            <p>Thirteenthly, From the abſurdities that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereupon; for then ſo many particular promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo many Covenants; whereas a Covenant is but a bundle of promiſes ſolemnly ſealed and confirmed.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts having excluded the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,<note place="margin">Such as will <hi>deficere in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis,</hi> will <hi>abundare in ſuperfluis;</hi> they are defective in the ſecond Command, therefore they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound in the X; whereas the text mentions but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as <hi>Moſes</hi> one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant throughout ch. 17.</note> divide the tenth into two; whereas they might as well make eight of it, as firſt, Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbors houſe. 2. Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbors wife. 3. Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbors field. 4. Nor his man ſervant. 5. Nor his maid ſervant. 6. Nor his ox. 7. Nor his aſs. 8. Nor any thing that is his.</p>
            <p>As they divide the Commandments: ſo others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Covenant; <hi>[I will be thy God,]</hi> This they make a new Covenant or a Covenant of grace. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 to 6. and from 7. to 14. <hi>And to thy ſeed will I give this land,</hi> a Covenant of works: they grant the former to be the new Covenant or Covenant of grace and why not the later? <hi>[I will be the God of thy ſeed, &amp;c.]</hi> but they might as well according to all the particular articles in the Covenant multiply the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant into ſeveral ſpecies, making every promiſe a Covenant and ſo many, promiſes ſo many Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, If Circumciſion was a ſeal of the Covenant of works, then the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> had no ſeal to the Covenant of grace at all, for they ſay that relates to the land of Canaan which they hold to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151468:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> be given to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works whereof Circumciſion was a ſeal. If this be granted, then was the Lord wanting to his people; for did they not ſtand in need of a ſeal of the rightouſneſs of faith as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; much more? <hi>Abraham</hi> though ſtrong in faith was ſore put to it, as appears by the ſtory, being willing to ſit down well contented with <hi>Iſmael,</hi> not having obtained the promiſed ſeed: Yea (<hi>cap,</hi> 16.3.) the holy Ghoſt ſeems to imply that he doubted ten years; therefore he uſed unlawful means to obtain iſſue, going in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Hagar.</hi> Did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtand in need of ſtrengthening and did not his ſeed much more? Had he a ſeal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the promiſe, and had not his ſeed the like? or did God ever make a Covenant with his people, and not ſeal it? Hath any a juſt title to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and not a right to the ſeals and conveyances? or had any ever a right to the Covenant of grace that had not an external right at leaſt to the ſeal?</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, Here is not onely an <hi>Huſteronprote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> (for thus <hi>Abraham</hi> is firſt under the Covenant of grace and then of works long after) but at the ſame time under both Covenants, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</p>
            <p>Sixtenthly, The Covenant of works admits of no repentance or mercy, therefore cannot be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this doth. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Seventeenthly, That Covenant was ſealed with bloud, (for the letting out of the bloud did ſignifie the ſhedding of the bloud of Chriſt) therefore it was not a Covenant of works: Again it 's to thee and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:151468:47"/> thy ſeed after thee, in their generations for <hi>ever; Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.8.<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>P. p.</hi> 43. The <hi>ever</hi> of the Law is to be underſtood of the time of the Goſpel-ſtate, if theſe words [to you and your ſeed in their generations] be put in. <hi>At negatur.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>He gave that land for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant, even to a thouſand generations.</hi> Now from <hi>Abraham</hi> to Chriſt there was but 42 generations, and therefore that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ceaſed not when Chriſt came in the fleſh, as ſome ſay. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Num.</hi> 25.13. <hi>Ex.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>this is my name for ever, this is my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to all generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighteenthly, If Circumciſion were onely a ſeal ſignifying, That God would give the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the land of Canaan, what need was there of this ſeal after they were poſſeſſed of the land?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The ſubject matter of the Covenant is, That they ſhould be circumciſed; but in that, all the works of the Law are included.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Rom.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. Circumciſion profiteth if thou keep the Law, ſaith the Apoſtle, on Gods part it was a ſeal of all the gracious promiſes, if on their part they did perform the condition, which was, to walk in obedience to his Commandments; but it did not profit them if they kept not the Law: as baptiſm now availeth not if men lead an evil life. The Apoſtle ſpeaks not by way of ſuppoſition, as of a thing impoſſible to be done, but as ſuppoſing it a thing poſſible evangelically to be done.</p>
            <p>If he had ſpoken of the perfect keeping of the law legally, (which is impoſſible) then all profitable uſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151468:48"/> is denyed to Circumciſion; but he would not ſo much detract from that holy inſtitution of God, as to denie all profitable uſe thereof. Circumciſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did bind them to keep the whole law perfectly, but it did profit them if there were an endeavor and a care in them to keep it, though imperfectly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.1. <hi>What priviledg then hath the Jew? what benefit then is there of Circumciſion, if the Jews were not juſtified by Circumciſion?</hi> Here are two queries, the Apoſtle anſwers to the firſt <hi>Much every way, but chiefly that to them were committed the oracles of God;</hi> that is, all the prophetical writings, propheſies and promiſes, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Theſe were committed to them, <hi>non ut alienae rei depoſitum;</hi> but as their own proper treaſure, if they had hearts to make uſe thereof: For the Covenant was made with all the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> many indeed loſt the benefit of it, not becauſe they were not comprehended in it; but becauſe of their unbelief, which deprived them of the benefit thereof: yet this unbelief could not make the faith of God, that is, the promiſe, of none effect; for though ſome did not believe, yet others did; not all but ſome, did not believe; for God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That as he keepeth truth in his promiſes: So there ſhould be always ſome in the Church which ſhould believe them. Thus (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7.) the Apoſtle ſheweth that all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> are not the elect ſeed; but doth not ſhew, That they were not under the outward adminiſtration of the Covenant, as appears from the 4 <hi>verſe,</hi> for of that Covenant <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks not. But if onely the elect and faithful
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151468:48"/> be admitted to the Covenant, as to the outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration thereof: then is there no ſubject left for the ordinance of baptiſm; for how ſhall we know who is elect and who not? It's therefore far better to give the ſeal to the 99 which are not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, than to paſs by one to whom it juſtly belongs.</p>
            <p>Thus much in anſwer to the firſt querie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3: To the ſecond querie the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle anſwers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Paul</hi> purpoſely deferred the anſwer to the 2 querie, to this place; becauſe in this place it received the fitteſt anſwer.</note> That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was not juſtified by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which the carnal Jew together with the works of the law reſted in, as appears by moſt of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. They not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the tenor of the Covenant of grace, did look at it with a carnal ey, as a Covenant of works; therefore Circumciſion was urged as neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. And in this ſenſe the yoke put upon the diſciples, was ſuch a yoke as that neither they nor their fathers were ever able to bear. It's not to be imagined that the Lord would impoſe any ſuch intollerable yoke of circumciſion as ſome conceive the meaning of the place to be, (for <hi>his yoke is eaſy, Mat.</hi> 11.28. and <hi>his commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.) misconſtruing the Lords meaning, and cleaving to the works of the Law; for which cauſe the Jews were cut off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. comp. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.5. <hi>(I will cut off thy mother) — becauſe they ſought rightouſneſs by the works of the Law, and not by faith in</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Covenant,</hi> which included Chriſt in the womb thereof. For Circumciſion was a ſeal of the remiſſion of ſins; or, as the Apoſtle calls it, a ſeal
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151468:49"/> of the rightouſneſs of the faith; which they had, or which was tendered unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. Jer.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Curſed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Covenant, (Gal.</hi> 3.) <hi>which Covenant I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of</hi> Aegypt. This Covenant was a Covenant of works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mind the words following, [<hi>which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of</hi> Aegypt] was this <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? was not this Covenant delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> 430 years after? for the breach of which they are here threatned. That the Law was taken by the Jews for a Covenant of works, is not denied, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. But that is diſtinct from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me tell you, As ſome pictures, if you look on them on this ſide, they reſemble the king or queen; on the other ſide another party: So that Covenant conſidered largely, as that whole doctrine delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the prefaces and promiſes, and all things that may be reduced to it; ſo it's a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, as appears from <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word that I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with you when I brought you out of the land of</hi> Aegypt,<note place="margin">Sum vobiſcum, dicit Jehovah, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> broke Covenant with God in tolerating idolatry, ſetting up two Gods, therefore God ſet up two Kings, and cut off the line of <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> ſo called <hi>ob contemptum, Jer.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Write ye this man childleſs, for</hi> (though he had ſeed; yet were they cut off in the captivity, ſo that) <hi>no man of his ſeed did ſit upon the throne of David for ever.</hi> And were not the Children of Iſrael caſt out?

Thus he dealt with the carnal Iſraelites, and with the body of that nation, and could the ſpiritual Iſraelite plead not guilty?

            <p>But here is the happineſs of a true Iſraelite, That God keeps Covenant with him and for him, there is no condition in that Covenant of grace, which Chriſt hath not undertaken to perform for us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when he ſees the Father angry, turns to the Son, the ſecond perſon in Trinity, ſaying, <hi>Lord undertake thou for me, Eſa.</hi> 38.14. There are two things by which we live, by what God ſaith, and what he doth; by a promiſe and a providence; <hi>thou haſt ſaid it and thou haſt done it,</hi> (v. 15.) <hi>In theſe two is the life of my ſpirit.</hi> Temporals were but as nuts and apples given to that infant Church in the time of their infancy, to engage their hearts to God.

            <p>Secondly, By virtue of this Covenant they had the Tabernacle of God amongſt them, a Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:151468:63"/> and they with their children members of that Church. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.13. <hi>He hath bleſſed thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren within thee.</hi> How highly doth the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol this chriſtian priviledg? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Ye are not come to Mount Sinai, but to Mount Sion,</hi> viz.

Great is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that members have in this reſpect.

If it be ſo ſweet on earth, where a few imperfect members mixed with many corrupt members meet together; ah! how much more ſweet will it be in heaven, when that great Aſſembly ſhall meet, and have no mixtures at all! Is it therefore no advantage to children that they may ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the Kingdom of heaven? But ah! how ſad will it be with them, if they be hereafter caſt out into utter darkneſs!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The preſence of God is in his Tabernacle, <hi>Exo.</hi> 40.34. The glory of the Lord filled the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, when they punctually obſerved the command of the Lord by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, By virtue of this Covenant the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, and ſtood betwixt <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19. <hi>q. d.</hi> Thou muſt ſtrike through my loins if thou wound Iſrael my firſt-born.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151468:64"/> Yea the Archangel Chriſt hath his Angels under him, which always behold the face of their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are ready at a beck (as knowing his mind by his looks) to revenge the wrong of theſe little ones, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. Yea this Angel of the Covenant (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.3, 9.) ſtands betwixt them and hell, ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the execution of that ſentence of wrath, <hi>[In the day thou ſinneſt thou ſhalt dy the death,]</hi> which is an axiom true at all times; but the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comes in &amp; reprieves ſuch for a while. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By the bloud of this Covenant were they brought out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> yong and old: Hence it is that he makes mention of this name, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>this is my memorial to all generations.

            <p>Seventhly, They have common gifts, conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſtraining grace by virtue of this Covenant, though their nature be not changed, as the prophet ſpeaks <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. Yet at leaſt they are reſtrained, but a lion is a lion ſtill though a tame lion. <hi>He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>gifts for the rebellious,</hi> that is, ſaving grace for ſome, Miniſters and people; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace for others, <hi>that the Lord God may dwell among them,</hi> elſe there were no abiding for the people of God in this world.</p>
            <p>Eightly, They had by this Covenant offers and tenders of grace, in that ſenſe they were called the children of the Covenant, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. partly becauſe it was tendered to them, (but not ſolely for this cauſe, for ſo all nations to whom the Goſpel is preached ſhould be in Covenant, which we utterly deny) and partly becauſe accepted by them; herein many are miſtaken that make the offers and tenders of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſimply as ſufficient to render a people in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, without their acceptation; but we ſay, There muſt be the accepting of thoſe offers
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151468:65"/> and tenders, and cloſing with Chriſt (externally at leaſt,) elſe it's no Covenant properly ſo called.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Many children have ſaving grace wrought in them by virtue of this Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.7. <hi>I will circumciſe the heart of thy ſeed. Jer.</hi> 31. That great intruder, ſin, that uſurps authority over all, (even over ſuch as have not ſinned after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion) comes in by the fall of our firſt parents: and why may not children there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be reſtored by the next parent inſtrumentally?</p>
            <p>If the Lord did admit ſuch onely as believe, then the faith whereby we believe were not given by any Covenant; but what ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah? ch.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>They ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greateſt,</hi> that is, yong and old; which knowledg is interpreted to be faith, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>I will write my Law in their hearts,</hi> what law, onely the moral law? Yea the evangelical law, if ſo, then the law of faith. Have then elect children no ſaving benefit by the Covenant till they believe? Yes, they have this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, That they ſhall believe; for there are promiſes for grace, 2 to grace.

To which place the Covenant mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27.) is to be referred, <hi>q.d.</hi> That Church of the Jews ſhall not fail in her ſpiritual offspring for ever: This is a promiſe <hi>for</hi> grace in the ſeed, <hi>to</hi> grace in that Church, out of which Covenant the Lord hath not excluded any children of believers; therefore parents have a ground to hope he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all, he having not excepted any. Here then is an object for the faith of parents to work upon, but know aſſuredly that according to your faith ſo things go with you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. laſt. <hi>Let thy mercy, Lord, be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us according as we put our truſt in thee.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.16. comp. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.15. <hi>If any man ſee a brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, let him pray for him, and it ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> It's not to be expected that all ſhould be heard in this particular, as it is not in that of <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.15. Such promiſes are not univerſal but indefinite, becauſe ofttimes not always the Lord grants ſuch their deſires; the meaning is, prayer is an ordinance to which God hath made ſuch a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe, and he often doth reſtore the ſick, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being put up by believers for them; therefore in ſuch caſes we are to rely on God by an act of recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151468:66"/> with God, may know much of his mind, and have a particular faith for a particular marcie, whether ſpiritual or temporal: children have general and indefinite promiſes, and conditional upon faith and obedience, ſuch as determin not the kind of good promiſed, nor the particular perſon, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true if performed to any perſon in any fort. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. Many ſpiritual and ſo temporal promiſes are indefinitely propounded and ſo to be underſtood, not that the Lord intends an abſolute and univerſal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of himſelf, neither is the act of faith in the application of it required to be an abſolute and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible perſuaſion that God will beſtow theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things upon us: but the Lord expects we ſhould rely on him to do what is moſt for his glory and our good. But let me tell you faith may do much, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 9.) <hi>When he ſaw their faith, he ſaid to the ſick of the palſie, Be bold, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> When he ſaw their faith, that is, the faith of them that brought him: So when he ſees the faith of parents bringing their children to Chriſt in the viſible way of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, (for I know no other viſible way to bring children to Chriſt) he ſaith to them, Your ſins are forgiven you. Thus children are ſaved by the faith of the parents, begetting faith in them. Hence that paſſage of <hi>David</hi> concerning his child, <hi>I ſhall go to it, it ſhall not return to me,</hi> he means not of that ſtate of death in the grave, (for what comfort could that be to <hi>David</hi> that he ſhould go to the the grave with it?) but the ſtate of glory, to which he was aſſured it was gone, and to which he ſhould follow after.</p>

That place of the prophet implies a multitude of ſuch in the Church, far above what had been in former times: to ſay it's meant of the elect, as uſually they interpret ſuch places, reacheth not the ſcope of the place which imports a greater number than ordinary in former times, whereas of the elect it would be true were they never ſo few, or in thoſe times no more of them, than had in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther age formerly been; therefore it is well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Covenant is the ground of faith, and not faith the ground of the Covenant: For who can believe without a promiſe? what ground hath the faith of the parent to work upon, if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the promiſe? <hi>Archimedes</hi> ſaid if he had but footing to ſtand upon, he would toſs the earth like a ball: and what cannot faith do (which in ſome ſenſe is ſaid to be omnipotent) if it have a promiſe to work upon? but if faith have no ground to work upon, it can do nothing.</p>

But were it not better to adminiſter the ſeal to 99 that are not really ſanctified, than deny it to any one to whom it doth belong.</p>
            <p>The third Argument is taken from Circumciſion. Infants were circumciſed under the law, therefore now to be baptized under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Covenant of grace made with the Jews and Gentiles is the ſame Covenant for ſubſtance, as hath been ſufficiently proved; though there be diverſitie of adminiſtrations thereof. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 8.

            <p>Secondly, Circumciſion and baptiſm are both ſeals of the ſame Covenant, and they are the ſame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments or ſeals for ſubſtance, and for the ſpiritual part and uſe thereof. Circumciſion ſealed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. And baptiſm doth the like.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may argue from the Analogie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Circumciſion and baptiſm: for they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151468:71"/> in the ſubſtantials, though they differ in ſome circumſtantials.</p>
            <p>Now they themſelves do confeſs we may argue from parity of reaſon or Analogie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When Analogie doth not inſtitute a piece of worſhip, but onely helps to the underſtanding of it; now as for the ordinance of baptiſm it's clear, but as for the application of it to this or that ſubject, we need the help of Circumciſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we do not reſt ſolely in the compariſon, but have a farther reaſon for it; now it's not the bare Analogie between Circumciſion and baptiſm, by which we enforce the baptiſm of infants, but the grounds of both from ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When it holds full proportion in ſcripture to that for which it's brought, which we ſay, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion doth to baptiſm, unleſs in ſome particulars wherein a peculiar reaſon may be given. We ſay then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They agree in their ſignification, for they hold forth to us mans corruption by nature.<note place="margin">
                  <p>The ſubſtance of all divinity lay in Circumciſion, (as <hi>Luther</hi> well obſerves) the like may we ſay of baptiſm; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would be good Divines, let us ſtudie our baptiſm: For the Lord hath put a great ſtreſs upon ſuch truths as ſeem little in the eys of many.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151468:73"/> the neglect of this Ordinance is dangerous, as the contempt is damnable.</p>
            <p>Thus far they agree, therefore (ſay ſome) Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was a type of baptiſm. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Paul</hi> contends with thoſe who labored to maintain jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ceremonies and types, (<hi>v.</hi> 10, 11.) ſhewing that Circumciſion, which was the profeſſion of the whole law, was fulfilled as a type or figure to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by Chriſt in baptiſm, and therefore that was to vaniſh away as the types did, when they were fulfilled, <hi>v.</hi> 12. He ſhews how we are circumciſed in Chriſt, which is ſealed and effected by baptiſm, in which we are aſſimulated to Chriſt, ſo that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is a chriſtians Circumciſion; and then are we ſaid to be circumciſed with the circumciſion of Chriſt when we are baptized.</p>
            <p>That Circumciſion is a type of baptiſm it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we examin the properties of a type.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Types are inferior to their antitypes, of which they are but ſhadows and figures: ſo is Circumciſion to baptiſm in many reſpects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Types were not true in themſelves compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, being a ſhadow of things to come; but in the body or truth which they type out, ſo in circumciſion there is a type of a type,<note place="margin">

               </note> yet I hope that none will denie, that there is an antitype or a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent type that comes in the room &amp; place of a former type. Though Circumciſion properly was not a type of baptiſm,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>, <hi>typus correſpondens,</hi> or a type an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to a type.</note> yet Circumciſion and baptiſm are both types of one and the ſame thing repreſented, as was ſhewed before. The ark and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm are two ſeveral types, yet both ſhadowing out our deliverance by Chriſt: So Circumciſion and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm are two diſtinct ſeals, but both holding forth to us our corruption by nature, and redemption by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They differ in circumſtantials, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the time, for the circumſtances of time and day were not built upon the Covenant, <hi>ergò,</hi> not perpetual. Circumciſion was on the eighth day, for which there was a ſpecial reaſon, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the weakneſs of the child the ſeventh day, being the critical day: but alſo becauſe that day was a type of the reſurrection of Chriſt, which was in the eighth day; and ſo the ſabbath is call'd the eighth day, <hi>John</hi> 20. The ſame number of days was obſerved in many other things, (therefore it cannot merely relate to the weakneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the child) as for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Prieſts, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.1. The cleanſing of the lepers, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10. The clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:151468:74"/> of the polluted Nazarites, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.9, 10. and for the purifying of the altar. <hi>Ezek</hi> 43.26, 27. and the offering of the ſacrifice, by which Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the eighth day ſeems to be typified, who roſe again for our juſtification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They differ in their ſubject, Circumciſion was adminiſtered onely to the males, baptiſm to the male and female. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The females were not capable of the former Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin entered into the world by man, being an active inſtrument of generation; whereas the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is a paſſive inſtrument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world:</hi> For if Adam had ſtood, we had not fallen though Eve fell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They differ in durance, Circumciſion was in force till Chriſt came, becauſe typical; but baptiſm continues to the end of the world: So that we ſee they agree in all the ſubſtantials, and almoſt in all things elſe, unleſs in ſuch things for which a ſpecial reaſon may be given.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore this Argument, as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the old Teſtament was applied to children: ſo alſo is baptiſm to be applied in the new; for of equals there is the ſame reaſon. Thus much for the 3 Argument, taken from the analogie between Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If children were circumciſed in the old, they are now to be baptized in the new, becauſe baptiſm ſucceedeth Circumciſion, (now what is ſucceſſion but the ſubſtitution of later things for former things
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151468:75"/> in the ſame ſubject, as is well obſerved) for when the Jews were converted, (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.38.) Peter enjoyns them not to be circumciſed but baptized; which ſhews, that baptiſm comes inſtead thereof. Thus <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. The ſcope of the Apoſtle was to take them off from the rudiments of the world, eſpecially Circumciſion, which troubled moſt of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>You are compleat in him, being circumciſed with the Circumciſion made without hands.</hi> But they might object, We want the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumciſion to us and our children, which was of ſingular uſe to the Jews to ſtrengthen their faith: The Apoſtle anſwereth, You are buried with him in baptiſm, You are circumciſed becauſe bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; For baptiſm ſupplies the place and room of Circumciſion, and is every way as advantageous to you: So that we plainly ſee they were compleat in Chriſt, as to this Ordinance ſealing outwardly. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sydenham</hi>) the Ordinance ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be changed, and the inverſion thus, That ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm ſhould be aboliſhed and Circumciſion ſet up again, and the Apoſtle ſhould expreſs himſelf after this manner, Ye are compleat in Chriſt, in whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ye are baptized with the baptiſm of Chriſt, being circumciſed with him; Would not this deduction be clear, That Circumciſion was ordained inſtead of baptiſm? Therefore we ſay, Either baptiſm ſucceeds the ſacrament of Circumciſion, as to children; or elſe ſome other Ordinance doth ſucceed; or elſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all remains in lieu thereof: But nothing elſe ſucceeds Circumciſion; therefore either baptiſm
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151468:75"/> ſucceeds it, or elſe there is no ſeal of the Covenant left as to children, but they without any viſible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Gods favour depart out of the world.</p>

            <p n="5">5. If they were broken off from the inviſible Church, then were they of it before, whether we ſpeak of reprobates or real members; if of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, then, according to their ſenſe, reprobates were broken off from the inviſible Church, which is not to be imagined; if of real members, then ſuch chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may fall from ſaving grace finally and totally: for thoſe individual perſons ſhall never be reſtored, though the branches ſpecifically conſidered, ſhall be reinſtated into the viſible bodie of the Church.</p>

            <p n="7">7.

            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I thus argue,</p>

            <p>The ſeventh Argument.</p>
            <p>Children are capable of the grace of baptiſm, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of baptiſm it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Therefore they are capable of the grace of baptiſm, both which it ſeals, and which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:151468:90"/> it conveys; for the Lord being a free agent, hath not limited himſelf to any time; but as before baptiſm, ſo ſometimes in, ſometimes after baptiſm he doth convey that ſpirit of grace to infants. The more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way for ſuch as are adult in the conſtitution of a Church, is by the word; but the Lord hath not tied himſelf to this way, eſpecially in a Church ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, but doth doubtleſs breath in this Ordinance alſo: for look what the navel is to the child in the womb, the ſame is baptiſm to infants in the womb of the Church. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.2. The child in the womb is not nouriſhed in an ordinary way, as by the mouth, but by the navel: even ſo infants are not ſanctified by the ordinary way of hearing, but by this of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. I know other ſenſes are given of that ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but as Bernard ſaid of the Pope, Either this is he or ſhew me ſuch another: So I ſay, Either this is the ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, or elſe let any man ſhew me a better.

            <p n="1">1. The way of Anabaptiſm is not the way of God; for firſt it's not of Gods planting, therefore ſecondly not of his watering.

            <p>Yea I fear ſome of them if they look into their hearts, will find them too-too-deſirous to make truth on their ſide, (having been plunged before they were dipped) and that that way might appear to them to be a way of God, which they moſt affected; having the perſons of ſome, and their doctrines in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for advantage ſake; if ſo, God may juſtly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them as he did Balaam, and (contrary to his own expreſs command) bid them, Go, anſwering them according to the idol which they ſet up in their hearts.</p>

We find no inſtance in ſcripture of any that were dipped or rebaptized, after that in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie they were dedicated to the ſervice of God by baptiſm; nor of any child of a believer ſuſpended till he came to years of diſcretion, and was able to give an account of his faith.

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this truth is not ſo clear, truth lies (as we ſay) at bottom, and is not eaſily found out, but by diligent ſearch and enquirie made. The eſſentials to ſalvation are clear and evident, but other truths not ſo.</p>

            <p>So much for the firſt Argument, namely, Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is not the way of God. I ſhall be brief in the reſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the neglect of this Ordinance of Chriſt doth argue the Church is ſtill in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and for this and other Wilderneſs ſins, may continue long in that ſtate; for their rebellions of old the Lord was angry with Iſrael, and ſeemingly did discovenant them, and caſt them off as none of his people, making them like the reſidue of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who all then died uncircumciſed, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezekiel ſpeaks; and is not the Lord angry with many of this generation, on whoſe ſeed he hath ſet no viſible ſign of his favor, but ſuffers every man to do whatſoever is right in his own eys? which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes makes a ſign of the Wilderneſs ſtate of the Church of God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Ye ſhall not do after all the things that ye do here this day, every man whatſoever is right in his own eys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider how angry the Lord was with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for deferring the circumciſion of his child: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was now going to be a reformer of others, and had not reformed his own familie, therefore the Lord would have ſlain him; and is not the Lord
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:151468:103"/> angry with not onely private chriſtians but ſome publick perſons, for their neglecting of this great Ordinance of infant baptiſm? I fear he is, which ſooner or later they will experience; for in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſecond commandment, God threatens to viſit the neglect of this Ordinance of God upon the fathers to the children, to the third and fourth generation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The contempt of this Ordinance argues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs of ſpirit, that many do ſo undervalue, nay deſpiſe this birth priviledge. Eſau for a little red pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſells his birth-right, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> promiſes, the land of Canaan, the Ordinances, with the ſeals of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and after he had ſo done, he left the Church of Iſrael, (as thoſe do that renounce their baptiſm) and went to Mount Seir, being not troubled for what he had done; therefore he was branded with that black cole of infamie as a profane perſon, [<hi>Eſau</hi> that is <hi>Edom</hi>] which words compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 12.14. do argue that the birth-right was not merely a civil thing, but typically did repreſent thoſe ſure mercies or holy things of David (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3.) held forth to us in the Covenant of grace. This example of Eſau the Apoſtle applies to the Church of the Jews in the new Teſtament, <hi>Let there be no profane perſon among you as was Eſau,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Do not part with your birth-right priviledges upon ſuch eaſie terms, as many now adays do, (for it ſeems they were apoſtatizing and falling back from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the new Teſtament, unto their former beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly rudiments) leaſt there be hereafter no place
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151468:104"/> left for repentance, though you ſhould ſeek it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with tears.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Can any forbid water that children ſhould not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we? Is there any impediment on Gods part prohibiting? no; for he bids us bring them to him: On childrens part prohibited? no; for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven: Or in reſpect of the thing it ſelf? no; for it's a paſſive Ordinance: What ſhould then hinder why children ſhould not be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Such as lay hold on the Covenant, and keep the Sabbath, (for theſe two uſually go together) ſuch will God make joyfull in the houſe of prayer, even in the Church of God. Let not the Eunuch ſay, (ſaith the Lord) I am a drie tree and have no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; nor the ſtranger ſay, I and my children are utterly ſeparated from the Lords people, for theſe will he bring to his holy mountain. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. (which is a Goſpel-promiſe as appears by the context.) Oh then lay hold on the Covenant for you and yours, if you deſire to ſhare in the ſoul-raviſhing joys of the people of God!</p>
            <p n="7">7. Conſider the viſion of Philpot, who tells us, That as Peter had a viſion a little before thoſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Cornelius came to him, by which he was much ſatisfied concerning his converſing with the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.17, 28. Even ſo this holy man of God M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Philpot, a little before ſome came to him to be informed in that great queſtion of infant baptiſm, had the like viſion; namely, a deſcription of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:151468:104"/> citie four-ſquare, into which we are ſolemnly to enter by baptiſm. For, ſaith he, the militant (<hi>i. e.</hi> the preſent) Church ought to conſent to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church. By which appearance he was much confirmed in the preſent truth.</p>
            <p>This teſtimonie of that worthy and eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, being an humane teſtimonie, may challenge an humane credulitie, though not a divine, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he was a judicious ſober man, not lead by fancie as many are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he was a Martyr of Jeſus, to whom, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Chriſt did eminently appear, and reveal thoſe things to them which he would not to the men of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3.. That when he had this apparition, he was near his death; now the ſoul doth <hi>prominere in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> ſhine forth in death, and ſees things more clearly being carried to the top of Mount Piſgah, the Mount of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That this viſion was never queſtioned by any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or others that ever I heard or read of,<note place="margin">We may be induced to believe by the Church as an inſtrument, but not as the formal reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which our faith is ultimately reſolved. <hi>Eccleſia eſt per quam, non propter quam credimus.</hi>
